# 🏡 Safe&Sound Security

This is my first project working on frontend engineering with HTML and CSS, and I’m super stoked to say I love it!
I’ve put many hours into this project, and seeing it come to life has been an awesome journey.

Safe & Sound Security is a full-stack inspired project that simulates a smart home security dashboard.
Right now it includes a login page that leads to a responsive dashboard UI.

Features
	•	🔑 Login page (navigates to dashboard)
	•	📊 Dashboard layout with space for status cards, controls, and notifications
	•	🎨 Responsive design (works on desktop & mobile)
	•	🌙 Clean and modern UI
